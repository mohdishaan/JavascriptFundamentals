Ques4: What is the Purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript and how do you declare them using the 'let' keyword?

Sol:

Purpose of declaring the variables in JavaScript:

1. Storing Data: Variables store values such as numbers, strings, objects, etc., that can be reused and referenced in the program.
2. Manipulating Values: You can perform operations on the values stored in variables (e.g., arithmetic calculations, concatenating strings, etc.).
3. Maintaining State: Variables help maintain the current state of the application, which can change over time (e.g., storing user inputs, scores in a game, or page settings).


Declaring variables using the LET keyword:

Syntax: let variablename = value;

-> let: The keyword used to declare a variable.
-> variableName: The name you give to the variable (must follow naming rules).
-> value: The value assigned to the variable. You can assign any type of data (number, string, boolean, object, etc.).

Eg:
let age = 25;           
let name = "Alice";     
let isStudent = true;
