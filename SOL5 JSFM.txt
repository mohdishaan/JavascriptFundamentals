Ques5: Explain the importance of comments in JavaScript and provide examples of single-line and multiline comments.


Sol:

Comments are an essential part of programming in JavaScript (and any programming language). They serve several important purposes:

1. Code Documentation: Comments provide explanations and descriptions about what specific sections of code do, making it easier for developers (including your future self) to understand the code's intent and functionality.

2. Improving Readability: Well-placed comments enhance the readability of the code, allowing others to follow the logic and flow of the program without having to decipher the code itself.

3. Facilitating Collaboration: In team environments, comments help communicate ideas and instructions among developers, ensuring everyone is on the same page regarding the code's purpose and usage.

Types of Comments in JavaScript:
1. Single-Line Comments: These comments are used for brief explanations and start with //. Everything following // on that line is treated as a comment and is ignored by the JavaScript engine.

Eg:
// This is a single-line comment
let x = 5;  // Declare a variable x and assign it the value 5


2. Multi-Line Comments: These comments are useful for longer explanations or for commenting out multiple lines of code. They start with /* and end with */. Everything between these symbols is treated as a comment.

Eg:
/* This is a multi-line comment.
   It can span multiple lines.
   Useful for longer explanations or notes. */
let y = 10;  /* Declare a variable y and assign it the value 10 */
