Ques3: : List and describe the five primitive data types in JavaScript.

Sol:

There are 5 primitive datatypes in JavaScript:

1. Number:
Represents both integer and floating point numbers.
Eg: 
Integers: 10, -5
Floating-point: 3.14, -0.01

2. String:
Represents sequences of characters (text). Strings are immutable and enclosed in either single quotes (' '), double quotes (" "), or backticks (` `).
Eg:
"Hello, World!"
'JavaScript'
`Template literal ${expression}`

3. Boolean:
Represents a logical entity and can have only two values: true or false.
Eg:
true 
false

4. Undefined:
Represents the absence of a value. A variable is undefined when it has been declared but has not been assigned a value.
Eg:
let x;  //declared but not assigned, so x is undefined

5. Null
Represents an intentional absence of any object value. It is often used to signify "no value" or "empty."
Eg:
let x = null;
